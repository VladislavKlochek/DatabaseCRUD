# DatabaseCRUD
 
Recreated one of the projects I did in college in a different language. It made me realize that it's better to spend a sufficient amount of time on planning and choosing design patterns, otherwise, you'll end up spending even more time trying to understand what's happening in your own code, especially if you're not very interested in the project's topic. Based on the above, I can tell you that you're better off not looking at the code. Just see how it looks and works. 

For database connection(just in case something wrong): 
Database name: Pharmacy
Username: postgres
Password: 1
